# Manekineko DAO and Stable Token Project

## Introduction

The **Manekineko DAO** is a decentralized autonomous organization built to support the **Maneki Neko Statheros**, a stablecoin backed by real-world assets (RWA) such as gold tokens (e.g., PaxGold), real estate tokens (e.g. Parcl), and other future RWA integrations. The DAO is governed by contributors using the **Manekineko Utility Token (MANEKIPF)**, which also serves as an incentive mechanism for completing various tasks. 

This meme beased fun and innovative project aims to provide decentralized, diversified, and transparent asset-backed stablecoins, while enabling contributors to earn rewards and participate in governance.

## How It Works

### 1. **Depositing into Vaults**
- Anyone can deposit supported RWA tokens into decentralized vaults. 
- Initially supported assets include:
  - **Gold-backed tokens** like NNN, PaxGold, and Digix.
  - Later iterations (v2, v3) will include other RWA tokens like NXAG (silver tokens), NPT (real estate tokens), diamond tokens, etc.
- Vault contributors receive interest paid in **USD Stable Tokens**, which are minted against the RWA assets.

### 2. **Generating Yield**
- USD Stable Tokens minted from the vaults are pooled and used for liquidity in DeFi applications such as trading and lending.
- Yield generated from these activities is distributed as interest to vault contributors.

### 3. **Utility of Manekineko Token (MANEKIPF)**
- **Governance**: MANEKIPF holders vote on DAO decisions, such as budget allocations, partnerships, and protocol upgrades.
- **Task Rewards**: Contributors earn MANEKIPF tokens for tasks like programming, marketing, and project coordination.

### 4. **Reputation Points (RP)**
- Contributors also earn **Reputation Points (RP)** alongside MANEKIPF for completing tasks. RP determines a contributorâ€™s ranking within the DAO.
- Formula:  
  **Voting Power = âˆš(MANEKIPF) * RP**  
  This ensures smaller MANEKIPF holders who actively contribute retain a meaningful vote.

## Benefits

1. **Decentralization**:  
   - Multiple RWA token providers mitigate risks and ensure a decentralized asset base.
   - Partnerships with smaller RWA token issuers diversify the project ecosystem.

2. **Transparency**:  
   - All vault activities and DAO decisions are fully visible on-chain.

3. **Earning Opportunities**:  
   - Vault contributors earn interest in stable USD tokens.
   - DAO contributors earn MANEKIPF tokens and RP for completing tasks.

4. **Fair Governance**:  
   - Voting power is weighted to encourage active contribution, not just token accumulation.
   - Prevents dominance by large investors while rewarding consistent DAO participation.

## Contributor Incentives

### Earning MANEKIPF Tokens
Contributors can earn MANEKIPF tokens by completing tasks outlined by the DAO. Examples include:

1. **Vault Contributions**:  
   - Example Task: "Generate $100,000 in vault assets."  
   - Reward: 100,000 MANEKIPF tokens and 1,000 RP.  
   - **How it Works**: If a user deposits $20,000 worth of gold tokens, they complete 20% of the task and earn 20,000 MANEKIPF tokens and 200 RP.

2. **Marketing Tasks**:  
   - Example Task: "Grow the official Twitter account to 100,000 followers."  
   - Reward: 1,000 MANEKIPF tokens for every 10,000 new followers.

3. **Project Coordination**:  
   - Example Task: "Develop a smart contract for vault management."  
   - Reward: Predefined MANEKIPF and RP allocation based on task complexity.

### Earning Reputation Points (RP)
- RP highlights contributorsâ€™ involvement in DAO activities.
- Higher RP increases voting power, rewarding active participation and ensuring meaningful DAO influence.

## Future Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Launch with Gold-Backed Tokens (NNN, PaxGold, Digix).
2. **Phase 2**: Onboard additional RWA tokens (e.g., silver, real estate, diamond).
3. **Phase 3**: Expand partnerships with small and medium RWA issuers.
4. **Phase 4**: Establish advanced liquidity pools for USD Stable Token yield generation.
5. **Phase 5**: Introduce advanced governance mechanisms and reward structures.

---

## Governance in the DAO

- **Voting Mechanism**: Decisions like marketing budgets and protocol upgrades are voted on by MANEKIPF token holders using their voting power.  
- **Budget Allocation**: Proposals for expenditures (e.g., Twitter marketing campaigns) are approved collectively.  
- **Reputation System**: RP ensures contributors with a track record of meaningful participation are prioritized in governance.

## Summary

The **Manekineko DAO** and **Neko Stable Token** provide a decentralized, transparent, and diversified way to mint stablecoins backed by real-world assets. The dual-token system of MANEKIPF and RP incentivizes participation and ensures fair governance, making it an inclusive project for anyone wishing to contribute to and benefit from the decentralized finance ecosystem.

By depositing assets, completing tasks, or participating in DAO governance, anyone can help shape the future of stablecoins and earn rewards along the way.
